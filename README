wavulator
=========

This tool simulates a 2D transverse wave in a closed box. It does this by
modelling each point in the grid as a mass, attached to the grid by a spring.
Each mass is also connected to each neighbouring mass by another spring. The
simulation uses RK4 for integration - however, after a certain amount of time,
the system stilldevolves into a chaotic standing wave, suggesting I need to do
more work to make the simulation stable.

To try out Wavulator, clone the repository and open wavulator.html in a HTML5-
compliant web browser.
