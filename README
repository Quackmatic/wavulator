wavulator
=========

This tool simulates a 2D transverse wave in a closed box. It does this by
modelling each point in the grid as a mass, attached to the grid by a spring.
Each mass is also connected to each neighbouring mass by another spring. The
simulation uses RK4 for integration - however, after a certain amount of time,
the system still devolves into a chaotic standing wave, suggesting I need to
do more work to make the simulation stable.

To try out Wavulator, clone the repository and open wavulator.html in a HTML5-
compliant web browser. Alternatively, Wavulator is also hosted on the GitHub
Pages for this repository - navigate to http://usn.pw/wavulator/wavulator.html
to try out Wavulator without cloning if you're lazy like me.
